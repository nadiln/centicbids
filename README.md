# CenticBids - By Nadil 

CenticBids is an online bidding platform which allow users to bid for online auctions. This project is created for Ascentic Interview test. I have covered major requirements like firebase authentication, UI developments, mobile architectural pattern and data retrieval  within a short period of time . I hope my codes and the standard methodologies implemented here will prove my skills.
